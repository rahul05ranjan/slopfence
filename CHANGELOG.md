## [Unreleased]

### Upgrade notes

- On projects with 200 or more Python files, slopfence now starts worker processes: one for every 100 files, up to one per CPU and at most 8. Findings are the same. To switch this off, pass `--jobs 1` or set `jobs = 1` in `[tool.slopfence]` ([#12](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/12)).
- **Starting on a project that already has findings is easier.** Record them once with `--write-baseline`, then fail only on new ones with `--baseline`. See "Baseline: start with the code you have" in the README ([#51](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/51)).
- `--list-rules` now reads `[tool.slopfence]`. With a config that is not valid it exits with code `2`, where v0.2 printed the rules ([#52](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/52)).
- JSON reports have a new `baselined` key. It is `0` when no baseline is used ([#51](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/51)).
- **`SLOP001` reads more files:** `setup.cfg`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile`, Jupyter notebooks and more requirements file names. The package names declared there are now sent to pypi.org, like those in `requirements.txt`. They are not sent when a requirements file, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock` of the project uses a private index. To leave a kind of file out, add it to `exclude`, for example `exclude = ["*.ipynb"]` ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53)).
- `Pipfile` entries are now checked. Before, the file was only read with `--check-imports` ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53)).
- An index on `test.pypi.org` now counts as a private index: TestPyPI holds other packages than PyPI. An index is public when its host is `pypi.org`, `files.pythonhosted.org` or `pypi.python.org` ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53)).

### Added

- `--jobs N` option and `jobs` config key: files are read, parsed and checked in up to `N` worker processes. Default: one per CPU, at most 8. The report is the same with any number of jobs. If worker processes can't start, a warning is printed and the files are checked in one process ([#12](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/12))
- **Baseline mode:** `--write-baseline FILE` records the findings of a run. `--baseline FILE`, or `baseline = "FILE"` in `[tool.slopfence]`, hides them, so only new findings are reported and only new findings fail the run. `--no-baseline` shows everything again. A finding is matched by its file, its rule and what it is about (a package, function or test name, or the text of the flagged comment), not by its line number. So it stays hidden when code moves or is reformatted. It comes back when the function, the test or the file is renamed, or the comment is reworded. It works with `--diff`, `--fail-on` and every output format ([#51](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/51))
- With a baseline, the summary says how many findings were hidden, JSON reports have a `baselined` count, and SARIF reports leave baselined findings out and say how many there were. A note says when baselined findings are gone, so the file can be written again. It only comes when the run checks everything the baseline holds ([#51](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/51))
- `--write-baseline` is careful with the file it replaces. It stops before the scan when the file is not a baseline (a forgotten file name can't destroy source code), and when the file holds findings that the run does not check: for files outside the checked paths, for excluded files, or for rules that are switched off. The file is replaced in one step. A note says when `SLOP001` findings may be missing because PyPI was not asked or did not answer ([#51](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/51))
- **Per-file ignores:** `[tool.slopfence.per-file-ignores]` turns rules off in the files that match a pattern. A pattern works like an `exclude` pattern. Dependencies and imports in a file where `SLOP001` is off are not sent to PyPI ([#52](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/52))
- **Severity overrides:** `[tool.slopfence.severity]` gives a rule another severity. Text, JSON and SARIF reports, `--fail-on` and `--list-rules` use it ([#52](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/52))
- `SLOP001` also checks ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53)):
  - `setup.cfg`: `install_requires`, `setup_requires`, `tests_require` and `[options.extras_require]`
  - `setup.py`: the same keywords of `setup()`, when the list is written in the file or in a variable. The file is read with `ast` and never run
  - `Pipfile`: `[packages]` and `[dev-packages]`
  - Jupyter notebooks: `pip install` lines in code cells and, with `--check-imports`, imports. A finding has the line and column of the `.ipynb` file, so `--diff` and SARIF work. A notebook that sets a private index, in a `pip install` line or anywhere else in a code cell, is not looked up. A notebook larger than 20 MB is not read
  - More requirements file names: `dev-requirements.txt`, `requirements.in`, `constraints.txt`, and `.txt` / `.in` files inside a `requirements/` folder
  - A file with one of these new names that is a plain list of names (no version, extra, marker or option anywhere) may be a list for apt or R. Nothing in it is reported when PyPI lacks more of its names than it has
- A private index in a project file also covers the files that don't name one. When a requirements file, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock` uses a private index, the dependencies in `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `Pipfile`, notebooks and requirements files with another name than `requirements*.txt` are not looked up, and a note says so. An index in an excluded file doesn't count, and `detect-private-index = false` switches this off ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- `dependency_links` in `setup.py` or `setup.cfg` make that file's packages private. So do `find_links`, and an `index_url` that is not PyPI, in the `[easy_install]` section of `setup.cfg`. They also cover the `setup.py` or `setup.cfg` in the same folder, because setuptools reads the two as one ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- With `--check-imports`, unknown imports are not looked up either when a notebook sets a private index, or when a `setup.py` or `setup.cfg` names another source in one of these ways: they may be private packages ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- A package that the project defines itself is never looked up. Its name comes from `[project] name` or `[tool.poetry] name` in any `pyproject.toml`, `[metadata] name` in any `setup.cfg`, and `setup(name=...)` in any `setup.py` of the project ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))

### Changed

- Requirements files are read more strictly. A line that pip would reject gives no finding, `python>=3.9` is not a package, and neither is a file name such as `vendor.tar.gz`. A document that is only named like a requirements file is skipped ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- The packages in a requirements file for another package manager (`requirements-conda.txt`, `requirements.apt.txt`) are no longer checked: they are not PyPI names. A private index that such a file names still counts ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- A package that one project file takes from a URL, a path, git or an index it names (`corp-auth @ git+https://...`, a `[tool.uv.sources]` entry, a Poetry `source`) is no longer looked up in the other files that name it. Before, `corp-auth` in `pyproject.toml` was sent to PyPI and reported although `requirements.txt` installed it from git ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- `--find-links` and `--no-index` in a requirements file make that file's packages private: a name that PyPI doesn't have may come from the links ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- With `--diff`, dependency files outside the diff are no longer looked up on PyPI. Their findings were already left out ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- **Much faster on big projects, with far less memory.** The CPython standard library and 127 installed packages (22,864 files) took 5 min 44 s and 8 GB of memory in v0.2.0. Now they take a little over 2 minutes with one process, and 35 to 45 seconds with 8 jobs on 4 cores. The main process needs about 0.3 GB, and each worker 40 to 80 MB ([#12](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/12))
- Checking a few files of a big project (pre-commit) is faster. The rest of the project is only read for what `SLOP030` needs, and its test files are not read at all ([#12](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/12))
- PyPI lookups are sent 8 at a time instead of one by one. 200 uncached names took more than 90 seconds and now take about 10. What is sent has not changed. A name is requested once per run, also when PyPI gives no answer for it ([#54](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/54))
- The PyPI cache file is written in one step, so two runs at the same time can't leave a broken file ([#54](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/54))
- Ctrl-C during a scan prints `slopfence: interrupted` and exits with status `130`, instead of a traceback. On Windows, worker processes that are still starting can print tracebacks of their own ([#12](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/12))
- With `--check-imports`, an import under an ignore comment (`# slopfence: ignore` on its line, or `# slopfence: ignore-file`) is no longer looked up on PyPI. Its finding was already hidden. Dependencies with such a comment were never looked up ([#52](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/52))
- `--list-rules` reads the project's config and shows the severities the project uses. A rule with another severity than its own also shows `(default: ...)`. Without overrides the output is the same as before ([#52](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/52))
- SARIF: a rule's `defaultConfiguration.level` is the severity the run used. It only differs from before when `[tool.slopfence.severity]` changes the rule ([#52](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/52))

### Fixed

- A checkout nested inside the project (a git worktree, clone or submodule, such as Claude Code's `.claude/worktrees/`) no longer counts as project code. Before, `SLOP030` reported every function as a duplicate of its copy, and `SLOP001` treated its modules as the project's own. A nested checkout that you name on the command line is still checked ([#58](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/58))
- A `pyproject.toml` whose tables have another shape than the format asks for (`project = "demo"`) stopped the run with a traceback. It is now read as far as it goes ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- A `pyproject.toml` whose tables have another shape than the format asks for (`project = "demo"`) stopped the run with a traceback. It is now read as far as it goes. A `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile` or lock file that the TOML or JSON reader gives up on (thousands of nested brackets, a number of ten thousand digits) is skipped ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- An index option in a requirements file was only seen at the start of a line, written in full and with a space before its value. It is now also seen after another option (`--pre --extra-index-url ...`), with its value attached (`-iURL`), and cut short the way pip allows (`--extra-index`). The same goes for `--find-links` and `--no-index`. Before, the packages of such a file were sent to PyPI ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- A `pyproject.toml` with a line that starts with `[` and goes on with a long run of spaces took very long to read: over 2 seconds for 1,500 spaces in v0.2, and eight times longer for twice as many. It is now read in the time it takes to read the line once ([#53](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/53))
- Findings at the same position (`import a, b` where neither exists) could be listed in a different order from run to run. They are now ordered by message ([#12](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/12))
- `SLOP030`: checking a folder or a few files now reports the same duplicates in them as checking the whole project. Before, one copy could be missed when the first copy was outside the checked paths, or when folder names sort differently as folders and as text (`a/` and `a-b/`) ([#52](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/52))
- A file that Python only warns about (an invalid escape sequence such as `"\d"`) counted as unparseable when warnings were turned into errors (`python -W error`). Such a file is now always parsed, and Python's warning about it is no longer printed ([#12](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/12))

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-03

Three new rules, private package support, and safer defaults for private code.

### Upgrade notes

- **Imports are no longer looked up on PyPI by default** ([#34](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/34)). Dependency files (`requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) are still checked as before. To also check imports in source code, as v0.1 did, pass `--check-imports` or set `check-imports = true` in `[tool.slopfence]`. See "What slopfence sends over the network" in the README.
- **If pip or uv uses a private index** (`PIP_INDEX_URL`, `pip.conf`, `uv.toml`…), `SLOP001` now makes no PyPI lookups, and the report says so in a note ([#17](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/17)). If that index only mirrors PyPI, set `detect-private-index = false`.
- Three new rules (`SLOP011`, `SLOP030`, `SLOP040`) are on by default. To roll them out gradually, use `ignore = ["SLOP030"]`, `--diff`, or `--fail-on medium` (SLOP040 is low severity).

### Added

- **New rules:**
  - `SLOP011` stub functions: a docstring that promises work ("Validate the token") over a body that returns hardcoded data or nothing ([#22](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/22))
  - `SLOP030` duplicate functions: identical functions across the project, ignoring names and docstrings. With `--diff`, changed functions are also reported when they're ≥90% similar to an existing one ([#11](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/11))
  - `SLOP040` swallowed exceptions: `except Exception: pass` and bare `except: pass` in application code (low severity) ([#21](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/21))
- **Private packages and indexes:**
  - `known-packages` config and `--known-packages` option: private packages that `SLOP001` accepts without a PyPI lookup, with glob support ([#15](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/15))
  - Private indexes in the environment are detected: `PIP_INDEX_URL` and the other pip and uv variables, `pip.conf` / `pip.ini`, `uv.toml`, and Pipfile sources. Then `SLOP001` makes no PyPI lookups. New `detect-private-index` config and `--detect-private-index` / `--no-detect-private-index` options ([#17](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/17))
  - Project-wide private indexes in `pyproject.toml` are detected (`[[tool.poetry.source]]`, `[[tool.uv.index]]`, `[tool.uv]` and `[tool.uv.pip]` `index-url` / `extra-index-url`, `[[tool.pdm.source]]`): that file's dependencies are neither reported nor sent to PyPI ([#34](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/34))
  - Index URLs are matched by host, never printed (they can contain credentials), and never treated as public just because they contain "pypi.org"
- **Better import checks:** `SLOP001` knows which package provides an import even when the names differ and the package isn't installed (`bs4` from `beautifulsoup4`, `google.cloud` from `google-cloud-storage`), and reads `uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `pdm.lock`, `Pipfile.lock` and `Pipfile` for indirect dependencies ([#16](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/16))
- **Options:**
  - `check-imports` config and `--check-imports` / `--no-check-imports` ([#34](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/34))
  - `fail-on` config and `--fail-on`: choose which severities fail the run ([#18](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/18))
  - `strict` config and `--strict` / `--no-strict`: unparseable Python files exit with code 2. Parse errors are also reported in SARIF as tool notifications, and JSON/SARIF use project-relative paths for them ([#19](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/19))
- **Reports:** notes, e.g. why `SLOP001` skipped lookups. Text output prints them, JSON has a `notes` list, and SARIF has `note` tool notifications
- **Docs:** demo GIF in the README, recorded with VHS from `docs/demo/demo.tape` ([#24](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/24)), plus the slopfence logo

### Changed

- **Privacy:** `SLOP001` no longer sends import names from your source code to PyPI by default (see the upgrade notes). The README and `SECURITY.md` explain exactly what is sent ([#34](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/34))
- The source distribution only contains the package, tests and the files needed to build it (about 40 KB instead of 410 KB) ([#35](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/35))
- Colour output: rule IDs are coloured by severity, locations are dimmed, and the summary counts are coloured. Plain output (`--no-color`, pipes, files) is unchanged

### Fixed

- `SLOP010` false positives from "for demo purposes" in human-written docs. It now needs "only" or placeholder wording nearby, and demo/example code is skipped ([#20](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/20))

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- GitHub Action: install into a private virtualenv instead of the runner's system Python, which recent runners reject (PEP 668), and pick a Python 3.10+ interpreter (`python3` or `python`, so it also works on Windows) ([#13](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/13))
- Crash on Windows when a finding quotes non-ASCII text such as an emoji: output is now always UTF-8. The crash exited with code 1, the same as "issues found" ([#13](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/13))
- PyPI version and Python badges on the PyPI page ([#9](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/pull/9))

### Added

- `[tool.slopfence]` configuration in `pyproject.toml` with `select`, `ignore` and `exclude` ([#10](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/10))
- `--exclude` option
- End-to-end CI tests for the GitHub Action (Linux, macOS, Windows, including SARIF upload to code scanning) and the pre-commit hook ([#13](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/13), [#14](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/14))

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Published to PyPI as `slopfence` (the project was originally named slopcheck, but that PyPI name belongs to an unrelated project)
- `slopfence` CLI with `--diff`, `--format text|json|sarif`, `--select`, `--ignore`, `--offline` and `--exit-zero`
- `SLOP001`: dependencies and imports that don't exist on PyPI, with a local cache
- `SLOP010`: placeholder comments left in finished-looking code
- `SLOP020`: tests that only assert on their own mocks
- `SLOP021`: tests whose only assertions are always true
- `SLOP022`: tests whose assertions are swallowed by try/except
- `SLOP051`: leftover AI chat text in comments and docstrings
- `# slopfence: ignore[...]` and `# slopfence: ignore-file` directives
- GitHub Action (`action.yml`) and pre-commit hook

### Project setup

- Project README describing the problem, design principles, planned detectors and roadmap
- Community health files: Code of Conduct, Contributing guide, Security policy, Support, Governance
- Issue templates, pull request template, CODEOWNERS, Dependabot and CI
