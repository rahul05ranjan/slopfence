    ``private_index`` says where the environment configures a non-PyPI package
    index (see ``indexes.find_private_index``); SLOP001 then makes no lookups.

    A private index in a project file covers that file. With ``inherit_index`` it also

    ``jobs``. Registry lookups always happen in this process.
