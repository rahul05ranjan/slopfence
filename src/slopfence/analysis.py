"""What slopfence learns from one Python file, in a form that can cross processes.

``analyze_file`` is the unit of work. It parses one file, runs the rules that need
nothing but that file, and returns a ``FileSummary``: the findings, plus the few
facts the project-wide rules need (function fingerprints for SLOP030, imports for
SLOP001). The syntax tree never leaves the function, so no two trees are in memory
at once. The summaries are kept until the run ends: memory still grows with the
project, but by a small summary per file and not by a tree per file.

``analyze_files`` runs it for many files, in this process or in worker processes.
Workers import this module. Keep it cheap to import, and never import the registry
here: a worker must not be able to reach the network.
