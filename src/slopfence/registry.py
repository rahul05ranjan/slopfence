"""PyPI lookups with an on-disk cache.

One lookup per package answers both package rules: whether the package exists
(SLOP001), and how long it has been on PyPI (SLOP002).

No answer never produces a finding. A network failure, a rate limit or a page that
is not PyPI's is "unknown": no rule reports it, it is not cached, and no more
requests start in that run.

Names can be looked up as one batch, a few requests at a time. The batch only
changes how fast the answers arrive: the request for a name is the same.
