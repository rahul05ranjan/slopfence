"""SLOP001: dependencies and imports that do not exist on PyPI.

Two checks:

* Declared dependencies are looked up by their distribution name. This is the
  most reliable signal. They are read from requirements files, pyproject.toml,
  setup.cfg, setup.py, Pipfile and ``pip install`` lines in Jupyter notebooks
  (see ``dependency.kind_of``).
* Imports in source code are opt-in (``check-imports``), because looking them
  up sends their names to PyPI and can reveal private package names. Even then
  they are only looked up when they are not stdlib, not part of the project,
  not installed, and not provided by a declared or locked distribution
  (``import yaml`` is provided by ``PyYAML``, see ``import_names``). Imports in
  the code cells of notebooks count too.

Nothing is looked up when the project or the environment may install packages
from a private index: a name missing from PyPI could then be a private package.
Nor is a name the project gives itself: a package that lives in the same
repository is not a hallucination.
