"""Jupyter notebooks as a source of dependencies and imports (SLOP001).

A notebook is JSON. Only code cells are read, and only for two things:

* ``pip install`` lines (``%pip install x``, ``!pip install x``, ...): the
  packages are declared dependencies;
* imports, which are only looked up with ``--check-imports``.

Every result carries the line and column in the ``.ipynb`` file itself, so
``--diff`` and SARIF work. The position of each source string is taken from the
JSON text while it is decoded, so it is exact for any formatting: Jupyter's
one-string-per-line layout, other indentation, or a minified file.
